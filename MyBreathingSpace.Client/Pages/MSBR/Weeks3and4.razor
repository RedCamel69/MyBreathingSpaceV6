                    This extended formal practice period is followed by inquiry into and exploration of participants’ experiences with in-class and assigned home practices. Typical topics include challenges and insights encountered in formal practice and in integrating mindfulness into everyday life.

                    </ul>
                    In this class, a brief guided body scan will be completed before the start of the sitting practice. Instruction will emphasise the development of concentration, embodiment, the capacity to train and re-direct attention, and the systematic expansion of the field of awareness.The group will explore mindfulness as a means of recognising and reducing the negative effects of automatic, habitual stress reactivity.
