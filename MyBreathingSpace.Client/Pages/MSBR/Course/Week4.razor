                            Conditioning and perception shape our experience. The practice of mindfulness helps us to cultivate curiosity and openness to the full range of experience and through this process cultivate a greater capacity to pay deeper, considered and flexible attention to internal and external stressful moments and events we experience. Stressful things are a part and parcel of life itself. It is how we handle those things that makes the difference between whether they rule or control our lives, or whether we can relate to them more lightly. Becoming more aware of the thoughts, feelings and body sensations evoked by events gives us the possibility of freeing ourselves from habitual, automatic, ways of reacting, so that we can, instead, mindfully respond in more skilful ways. Mindfulness offers ways of working with, reducing and recovering more quickly from stressful situations and experiences.

                        <p>
                            In general, we react to experience in one of three ways:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    with <b>indifference</b> so that we switch out from the present moment and go off somewhere else ‘in our heads’
                                </li>
                                <li>with <b>attachment</b> – wanting to hold on to experiences that we are having right now, or wishing we were having experiences that we want rather than what we are experiencing</li>
                                <li>with <b>aversion</b> – wanting to get rid of experiences that we are having right now, or avoid experiences that me be coming along that we do not want.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each of these ways of reacting can cause problems, particularly the tendency to react to unpleasant feelings with aversion. For now, the main issue is to become more aware of our experience as we react automatically (this awareness is the first essential step towards responding mindfully).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regularly practising sitting meditation gives us many opportunities to notice when we have drifted away from awareness of the moment, to notice with a friendly awareness that whatever it was that took away our attention, and to gently and firmly bring our attention back to our focus of attention, reconnecting with moment by moment awareness. At other times of the day, deliberately using the Breathing Space whenever we notice unpleasant feelings or a sense of ‘tightening’ or ‘holding’ in the body, provides an opportunity to loosen the grip of habitual, automatic reactions to stress.

                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Remember to use your body as a way to awareness. It can be as simple as staying mindful of your posture. You are probably sitting as you read this. What are the sensations in your body at this moment? When you finish reading and stand, feel the movements of standing, of walking to the next activity, of how you lie down at the end of the day. Be IN your body as you move, as you reach for something as you turn. It is as simple as that.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Just patiently practise feeling what is there. The body is always there. Practise until it becomes second nature to know even the small movements you make. If you are reaching for something, you are doing it anyway; there is nothing extra you have to do. Simply notice the reaching. You are moving. Can you train yourself to be there, to feel it?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is very simple. Practise bringing your attention back to your body again and again. This basic effort, which paradoxically is a relaxing back into the moment, gives us the key to expanding our awareness from times of formal meditation to living mindfully in the world. Do not underestimate the power that comes to you from feeling the simple movements of your body throughout the day.

                            Reacting and Responding
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Automatic reactions are very important; our ‘fight, flight and freeze’ mechanism has allowed humans to deal with many life threatening situations over the centuries. For example, in times past we may have come across a sabretooth tiger whilst out hunting. This external experience triggered a reaction of alarm and set off a stress reaction. The mind and body instantly went into a state of hyperarousal; muscles became tense, strong emotions were experienced, chemicals in the brain and body were released and blood was directed away from the digestive system and towards the muscles. The state hyperarousal allowed humans to think and act quickly; it potentially saved lives! You might think that by not living in such hostile environments we rarely experience this reactive response, but the automatic reactions to stress are a well-trodden unconscious path, and can be triggered without our awareness. The difficulties we face as modern western humans have changed and often relate to our psychological experiences; social interactions and relationships or social status, but our stress response system continues to react in the same instinctive way. It seems that it is sufficient to feel threatened even if the threat is not ‘real’. It is no longer socially acceptable to ‘fight, run or freeze’ exacerbating the stress we feel and making simple problems seem worse. By attempting to ‘wall off’ the stress we hold it inside. The internalisation of the stress reaction process potentially increases our risk of illness.

                            Mindfulness provides us with a choice, we can carry on instinctively reacting to the stresses we experience and treat our negative experiences and situations as perceived threats, thereby giving them greater emphasis and potential ‘control’ or we can use mindfulness to begin to become more aware of them, examine them and relate to them more lightly. How we handle stressful experiences depends on how we relate to them.

                            @*Reactions to more up-to-date events might be described in the three following ways:

                            Indifference; for example, generated out of boredom may result in ‘switching off’ from the present moment; we feel indifferent to our experience.

                            Attachment; for example, we may want to hold onto the experience of right now or wish we were having an experience from our past or strive to have a similar experience in the future.

                            Aversion; for example, we may want our current experience to go away, we may feel angry towards it and avoid situations that may result in a similar experience in the future.

                            Each of these ways of reacting can create problems, but for now the main focus is to become more aware of our experience, so that we can respond mindfully rather than reacting automatically. Regularly practising sitting meditation provides us many opportunities to notice when we have drifted from the awareness of the present moment. At which point we observe with curiosity where our attention has been and then gently, but firmly bring it back to the focus of the meditation and reconnect with the moment by moment awareness.

                            At other times of the day, whenever you notice unpleasant emotions or sensations of tightening or holding of tension in the body, use the three step breathing space as an opportunity to respond

                            rather than react. Alternatively you might want to try the STOP method to gently guide you back to the focus of your meditation.*@

                        <p>
                        Remember to use your body to as a way staying in the present; we take the daily movements of our body for granted. What is your posture like as you read this and what sensations do you notice in your body? When you stand feel the movement of standing, pay attention to the detail of your movements. As you reach, pick something up, turn around, and become aware of the small movements. When you walk and when lie down in bed tonight, slow down a little, what do you notice? Keep practising until it becomes second nature to be aware of all the small movements you make. There is nothing extra you have to do, just be in the moment with your body and notice.

                        <h2>Turning towards the difficult</h2>
                        <p>
                            The easiest way to deal with difficulties that arise is to stop trying to make things different. Allow the experience to happen. Simply notice and observe the thought, the body sensation and the emotion; cultivate a ‘willingness to experience’. This allows us to relate differently to experiences that have a strong pull on our attention, however, powerful they may seem. When we see them clearly we don’t get pulled into trying to supress or avoid them. We begin the process of freeing ourselves from them.

                            With a kindness and gentle attitude we deliberately turn towards any painful experiences. If the mind is frequently drawn away from the focus of our meditation to a painful thought, emotion or body sensation become aware of whatever it is that is pulling the attention away. Firstly, we gently explore the bodily sensations that occur alongside the thought or emotion; we then deliberately move the focus of our awareness to that part of the body where the sensation is strongest. We use the breath as a vehicle to do this, taking a friendly awareness to that part of the body by using the mind’s eye to breath into it and breathing out of it.

                            Notice how we are relating to the thought, emotion or body sensation. Are we reacting or mindfully responding to what is arising? If we react we may increase the persistence. We may be with an arising thought, feeling, or body sensation, but we are not allowing it to be there, we may want to be rid of it, creating tension in the muscles and feelings of irritation or fear. By acknowledging it, allowing it to exist and breathing into where we feel it in our bodies, we give the message to ourselves that it is okay to be open to whatever it is that is causing the pain or upset. It is okay to feel threatened, fearful, angry or hurt and to feel the tension in your body in these moments. In moments of awareness you can recognise these agitations for what they are, thoughts, feelings and sensations in the body. Allowing is not about resigning ourselves to it, but rather it is a first step to allowing us to become more fully aware of the difficulty and responding to it more skilfully. It allows us to find space to move away from the ‘fight or flight’ stress reaction. Our relationship with stress is lighter and less damaging.

                        <h2> Viktor Frankl Quotes</h2>
                        <p>
                            "Between stimulus and response there is a space.

                            In that space is our power to choose our response.

                            In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

                            When we are no longer able to change a situation,

                            we are challenged to change ourselves."

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            “To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of a gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative.”

                        <p>
                            Human beings are remarkably resilient to stress. We are expert copers and problem solvers, using our own internal resources, pleasurable and meaningful activities, and encouragement and support from family and friends, to deal with stress. However, it is also true that our usually stable balance can be pushed over the edge in to dysregulation and disorder if it is taxed beyond its capacity to respond and adapt. Health can be undermined by a lifetime of ingrained behaviour patterns that compound and exacerbate the pressures we continually face. Our automatic reactions to stress, triggered without awareness, often exacerbate the stress, making simple problems into worse ones, and largely determining how much stress we experience. A lifetime of unconscious reactivity to stress significantly increases our risk of eventual breakdown and illness.

                        <p>
                            Like the person depicted in the Figure above we all experience external stressors (shown in small arrows above the head) from the biological, physical, social, economic and political forces that bear on us and generate changes in our bodies, our social status and our lives generally. From the inside,

                            our thoughts and emotions are strongly affected by our perception of these outside forces, and also generate their own stressful reactions, producing another whole set of pressures and demands (shown as the arrows inside the box, labelled ‘Internal stress events’).

                            Some stressors affect us over extended periods of time, these are called chronic stressors. For example, taking care of a family member who is disabled is a form of potential chronic stress. Other stressors come and go over relatively short periods of time; for example, getting something completed to a deadline. These are called acute stressors. We react to stressors in different ways, depending on how fare we perceived them as treats to our well-being or sense of self. Our reactions can range from minimal (where little or no threat is perceived) to an automatic alarm reaction where the stressor is highly charged for us emotionally, or is perceived as being a definite threat in some way.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            This alarm reaction is our body’s way of clearing the decks for defensive or aggressive action, to protect ourselves in life threatening situations, and to maintain or regain control. People, in common with animals, go through a physiological reaction when feeling under threat, called the fight or flight reaction. This leads to a state of physical and psychological hyperarousal, which is characterised by muscle tension, strong emotions, a rapid cascade of nervous-system firings, and release of stress hormones such as adrenaline. We become very alert an attentive. The heart beats faster raising the blood pressure, and blood is redirected from the digestive system (causing ‘butterflies’ in the stomach) to the large muscles of the arms and legs. If you are about to be eaten by a tiger, there is no point in continuing to digest your food, you need to have as much energy as possible to run, or fight. This activity is regulated by the autonomic nervous system.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            The fight or flight reaction helps us to survive when we find ourselves in life threatening situations, but it can become a problem. Much of our stress comes from threats, real or imagined, to our social status, rather than our lives. The fight or flight reaction can kick in when there is no life threatening situation facing us. It is sufficient for us just to feel threatened. Our body and mind react automatically, whether the threat is real or not. If this happens often enough, unfortunately hyperarousal can become a permanent way of life. This can manifest in chronic muscle tension, shakiness, faster heart rate, and frequent urges to flee or to ‘lash out’ in anger or get into arguments or fights.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            What we do when the fight or flight reaction is building up inside us, but we feel unable to fight or run because both are socially unacceptable, and we know neither will solve our problems? The common way to deal with these feeling is to suppress them or deny them, hiding them from others and sometimes even from ourselves. We internalise our stress reaction and carry on as usual, holding it all inside. Instead of getting the resolution that fighting or running brings, which leads to physical release and recovery afterwards, we just carry the arousal around inside ourselves, which plays havoc with our bodies, and keeps our thoughts and feelings agitated.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            If this becomes a way of life, and we have no healthy way of releasing the build-up tension, we can drift into a state of chronic hyperarousal that we can come to think of as ‘normal’. This can lead to long-term physiological dysregulation, with problems such as high blood pressure, digestive problems, chronic headaches, back aches, and sleep disorders, as well as psychological distress such as chronic anxiety.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Many people cope remarkably well with extremely trying personal circumstances, and have developed their own strategies for doing so. They know when to stop and take time out, they have hobbies and other interests to take their minds off things, and they give themselves advice, reminding themselves to look at things differently and not to lose perspective. People who do this tend to be the stress hardy ones.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Many people cope with stress in ways that are actually self-destructive. These attempts at control are labelled ‘maladaptive coping’ in the figure above, because although they do help us tolerate stress and give us some sense of control, in the long run they wind up creating problems and making life more stressful. Such strategies include denial of what is happening, and although denial can help in the short-term, it eventually becomes unhealthy. Workaholism, and overeating, can also be strategies that avoid perceiving and dealing with the real problem. To cope with stress in our lives many of us use alcohol, caffeine, sugar, nicotine, and all sorts of over the counter or prescription drugs. When these become habitual, or the main or only methods of coping, they can put yet more stress into our systems, as in shown in the Figure above by the stress arrows going from substance dependency back into the person. Ultimately, all maladaptive coping can be addictive. Sooner or later the accumulated effects of stress reactivity, compounded by unhelpful ways of dealing with it, lead to breakdown in one form or another; exhaustion, burnout, physical illness, or recurrent depression. Whatever form it takes it becomes one more stressor feeding back into the person, and requiring even greater adaptation.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            When we get caught up in this vicious cycle, it can seem just the way life is, that there is no other way, but getting caught in stress reactivity is neither normal nor inevitable. We have far more resources and options than we realise. The first step on the road to recovery is to use mindfulness to become aware of what our own patterns are.
